NAME
----
pingu - Multi ISP policy routing, failover and load-balancing daemon


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pingu* ['-dhvV'] [*-a* 'SOCKETPATH'] [*-c* 'CONFIG'] [*-p* 'PIDFILE']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The pingu utility monitors specified interfaces and sets up an alternate
route table for each specified interface in which it mirrors all routes
using that interface. It also sets up a route rule so that this alternate
route table is looked up for traffic where the source IP address matches
the primary IP address of the corresponding interface. This guarantees
that a service bound to the primary address of an interface will always
use routes from that interface.

It can also ping specified hosts at regular intervals to detect if a
gateway via a certain interface goes down. It will then remove the default
gateway(s) via this interface from main route table so that traffic not
bound to the failed interface will fail over to other configured interfaces.

Pingu can also set up a multipath nexthop defafult route for interfaces
configured as "load-balance"
